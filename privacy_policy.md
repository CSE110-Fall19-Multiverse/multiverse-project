# Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Multiversity app for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect
New Multiversity accounts are created with email addresses and passwords.

You may optionally add or remove first name, last name and profile picture to your account, at any time in Multiversity’s app. Email addresses are only used for logging in, password resets, and sending notifications that you request. We don’t send promotional emails.

We store information about your posts, comments to sync this information between the website and your devices. We also collect anonymous statistics about which podcasts are most popular to help inform our recommendation engine.

## Technical basics
If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing.

If you upload files to Multiversity, we need to store them until you delete them.

If you subscribe to a password-protected podcast, we need to store the credentials you provide in order to keep it updated.

Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

## Ads and analytics
Multiversity’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.

No personal data is used to target Multiversity’s ads except the categories of podcasts that you’re subscribed to, such as “Technology” or “Business”. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total subscriptions from the ad.

## Information usage
We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Multiversity’s functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people listen to a particular podcast with Multiversity.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security
We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are hashed, not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently bcrypt).

## Accessing, changing, or deleting information
You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Multiversity iOS app.

Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.

Multiversity may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Information for European Union Customers
By using Multiversity and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

## International Transfers of Information
Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Consent
By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us
If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email multiverse.aufish@gmail.com. Please note that account deletion should be done within the Multiversity app, not via email requests, for security reasons.

## Changes to this policy
